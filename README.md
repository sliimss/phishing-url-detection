# Phishing URL Detection using Machine Learning

## Introduction

Cybersecurity is a pressing concern in today's technology-driven world. With the increasing use of the internet for daily activities, the threat of malicious URLs and websites has become a major challenge for governments, businesses, and individuals. Phishing attacks, in particular, pose a significant risk by tricking users into revealing sensitive information.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust phishing URL detection system using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify suspicious and potentially harmful URLs, helping users stay safe from phishing attempts.

## How it Works

1. **Dataset Loading:** We utilize a labeled dataset of URLs, indicating whether they are phishing or legitimate.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** We apply techniques like tokenization and count vectorization to convert URLs into numerical representations.

3. **Model Training:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and classification algorithms such as logistic regression and Naive Bayes multinomial are used to train the model.

4. **Model Persistence:** The trained model is saved in a .pkl file, enabling quick and efficient future predictions.

5. **Prediction:** The Flask-based user interface allows users to input URLs. The system loads the pre-trained model and predicts whether the URL is a phishing attack or not.

6. **Result Storage:** Prediction outcomes are stored in a database for future reference.

## Getting Started

To use the system, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Flask app to start the user interface.
4. Input any URL to see the prediction result.
